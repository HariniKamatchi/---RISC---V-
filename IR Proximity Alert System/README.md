# üî¶ IR Proximity Alert System

A compact safety and automation project using the VEGA Aries board and an IR sensor.  
This system detects nearby objects and instantly alerts you using a buzzer and LED indicators.

## üîå Pin Connections

| Component      | VEGA Aries Connection          |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| **IR Sensor**  | VCC ‚Üí 3.3V                     |
|                | GND ‚Üí GND                      |
|                | OUT ‚Üí GPIO1 (Analog Input)     |
| **Buzzer**     | VCC ‚Üí 3.3V                     |
|                | I/P ‚Üí GPIO0                    |
|                | GND ‚Üí GND                      |
| **LED Strip**  | GND ‚Üí GND                      |
|                | Red ‚Üí PWM0 (GPIO0)             |
|                | Yellow ‚Üí PWM1 (**unused**)     |
|                | Green ‚Üí PWM2 (GPIO2)           |

> üß† Note: GPIO0 is shared between the **Red LED** and **Buzzer**. Control them in sequence to avoid conflict.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. The IR sensor monitors for objects within a short range.
2. If an object is detected:
   - üîä **Buzzer beeps**
   - üî¥ **Red LED turns ON**
3. If no object is nearby:
   - üü¢ **Green LED remains ON**
   - System stays in standby mode

All activity is logged on the **Serial Monitor** for real-time feedback.
